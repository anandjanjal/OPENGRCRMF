# Roadmap

This roadmap is anchored to project initiation in **February 2026** and reflects a structured, continuing development initiative.

The timeline represents planned milestones and may evolve as the open-source initiative expands.

## Phase 1 — Foundations & Alpha Documentation  
**February 23, 2026 – June 30, 2026**

Objective: Establish architectural foundation and publish initial documentation release.

### Deliverables
- Define modular architecture for RMF workflow automation
- Draft SSP and POA&M structured data models
- Define control mapping model aligned to NIST SP 800-53 (Release 5.2.0 or subsequent revisions)
- Publish Whitepaper v1 (PDF)
- Document Zero Trust alignment model
- Publish governance documentation

### Milestones
- **March 15, 2026:** Core repository structure finalized
- **April 15, 2026:** RMF workflow model + ATO artifacts model complete
- **May 15, 2026:** Zero Trust alignment documentation complete
- **June 30, 2026:** Release v0.1 (Alpha Documentation Release)

## Phase 2 — DevSecOps & Zero Trust Integration Specifications  
**July 1, 2026 – December 31, 2026**

Objective: Expand framework toward integration modeling and schema definition.

### Deliverables
- DevSecOps integration specification (CI/CD telemetry ingestion, scanner mapping, evidence capture)
- Zero Trust alignment expansion (identity, segmentation, monitoring integration mapping)
- Sample continuous monitoring workflows
- Structured POA&M lifecycle schema definition
- Whitepaper v2 (expanded integration focus)

### Milestones
- **August 15, 2026:** DevSecOps integration model published
- **October 15, 2026:** POA&M schema v1 defined
- **December 31, 2026:** Release v0.2 (Integration & Schema Specification)

---

## Phase 3 — Public Beta Documentation & Community Expansion  
**January 1, 2027 – December 31, 2027**

Objective: Expand cross-framework mappings and enable structured community participation.

### Deliverables
- Expanded control mapping references
- Cross-framework mapping approach (CMMC, FedRAMP where applicable)
- Contributor guidelines refinement
- Optional reference implementation stubs (contributor-led)
- Public technical discussions/webinars

### Milestones
- **March 31, 2027:** Control mapping expansion published
- **June 30, 2027:** Contribution workflow finalized
- **December 31, 2027:** Release v0.3 (Public Beta Documentation)

---

## Phase 4 — Optional Commercialization Pathway  
**January 1, 2028 – December 31, 2028**

Objective: Evaluate sustainability and broader deployment options.

### Deliverables (Optional, Dependent on Adoption)
- Managed hosting feasibility assessment (CONUS-based)
- Compliance-as-a-Service operational model evaluation
- Workforce training module outlines
- Hiring plan contingent on adoption and partnership growth

### Milestones
- **June 30, 2028:** Managed service feasibility report
- **December 31, 2028:** Release v1.0 (Framework Maturity Milestone)

---

## Notes

- This initiative is independently developed and vendor-neutral.
- It does not claim federal endorsement.
- Commercialization steps are contingent upon adoption and are not required for framework viability.
- Development will proceed iteratively and transparently via public documentation and repository updates.
