# Zero Trust Alignment Model

## Overview

This document describes how the OpenGRC RMF Framework aligns governance and compliance workflows with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles.

Zero Trust is a security strategy centered on the principle of "never trust, always verify," requiring continuous validation of identity, device posture, network segmentation, application integrity, and risk context.

The objective of this framework is not to implement Zero Trust controls directly, but to provide governance and compliance mechanisms that support operational validation of Zero Trust maturity.

## Zero Trust Design Principles Supported

The framework models compliance alignment across the following Zero Trust pillars:

### 1. Identity

- Role-based access control mapping
- Privileged access documentation
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) tracking
- Identity provider integration points
- Continuous authentication evidence tracking

### 2. Devices

- Device posture validation records
- Endpoint compliance status ingestion
- Device inventory tracking
- Continuous device risk monitoring integration

### 3. Network / Environment

- Micro-segmentation modeling
- Logical boundary documentation
- Enclave definition and mapping
- Network control inheritance tracking

### 4. Applications & Workloads

- Secure development lifecycle alignment
- DevSecOps telemetry ingestion
- Container security evidence tracking
- Configuration compliance validation

### 5. Data

- Data classification mapping
- Encryption control validation
- Data access audit traceability
- Sensitive data flow documentation

## Continuous Verification & Risk Context

Zero Trust requires dynamic risk evaluation rather than static authorization.

This framework supports:

- Continuous monitoring data integration
- Real-time POA&M updates
- Risk scoring alignment with control weaknesses
- Authorization state visibility

By integrating Zero Trust-aligned telemetry into compliance workflows, the framework enables more transparent, audit-ready validation of Zero Trust implementation maturity.

## Relationship to RMF

Zero Trust does not replace RMF. Instead, it enhances the operational security posture of systems governed by RMF.

This framework connects Zero Trust operational telemetry with:

- NIST SP 800-53 control tracking
- System Security Plan documentation
- Security Assessment reporting
- Continuous monitoring processes

The result is improved alignment between policy-level security mandates and day-to-day governance execution.

---

## Intended Outcome

The Zero Trust Alignment Model aims to:

- Improve visibility into Zero Trust control implementation
- Reduce documentation fragmentation
- Strengthen continuous monitoring maturity
- Support risk-based authorization decisions

This alignment enables organizations to modernize securely while maintaining regulatory and compliance integrity.
