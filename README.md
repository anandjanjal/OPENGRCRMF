# OPENGRCRMF
Open-source GRC framework to automate NIST RMF workflows, ATO lifecycle artifacts, and Zero Trust alignment for federal and regulated environments.
# Open Federal GRC Framework (RMF + ATO + Zero Trust)

## Mission
This project is an open-source framework to help federal agencies and regulated organizations operationalize:
- NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- ATO lifecycle artifacts (SSP, SAP, SAR, POA&M, continuous monitoring)
- NIST SP 800-53 control implementation tracking
- Zero Trust alignment and continuous verification
- DevSecOps-integrated compliance automation

## Why this matters
Cybersecurity compliance is often slow, manual, and fragmented. Many organizations still rely on spreadsheets and disconnected tools for SSP/POA&M tracking, evidence collection, and continuous monitoring. This reduces visibility, delays ATO timelines, and increases risk.

This project provides a documentation-first, automation-ready architecture to modernize compliance operations while strengthening security outcomes.

## Scope (Initial Modules)
- RMF workflow automation model
- ATO artifact templates and evidence lifecycle
- POA&M data model and prioritization workflow
- Control mapping engine (NIST 800-53 baseline first)
- DevSecOps integration points (CI/CD telemetry -> compliance evidence)
- Zero Trust alignment mapping (identity, segmentation, monitoring, policy enforcement)
